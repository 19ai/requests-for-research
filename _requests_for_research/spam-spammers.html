<p>Investigate the use of language models to remove the profit from
spamming.</p>

<p>
  Spammers generate a huge amount of undesirable traffic and
  attention. Their emails are merely annoying for most people, but a
  small fraction of users fall into their trap. Spammers receive
  responses from users extremely infrequently. Therefore, they
  manually reply to each email.
</p>

<p> The task is to build a bot that automatically replies to spam
  emails. Such a bot shouldn't be easy to detect, which could be
  achieved by use of
  a <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.02410.pdf">powerful language
  model</a>.

it could be a pretty great service for the world. </p>
