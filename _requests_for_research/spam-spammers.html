<p>Investigate use of language models to make spamming not-profitable</p>

<p>
  Spammers generate humongous amount of undesirable traffic and attention. 
  Their email messages are annoying for most of people, but a small fraction
  of users follow their trap. Spammers receive responses from users extremely
  infrequently. Therefore, they manually reply to each of emails. 
  The task is to build a bot that automatically replies to spam emails.
  Such bot shouldn't be easy to detect, and this could be achieved by use
  of a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02410">powerful language model</a>.
  This system would be a great asset for humanity.
