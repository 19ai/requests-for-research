<p>Train a language model capable of generating funny jokes.
This request can be solved in following two steps.
</p>

<p> 
Firstly, obtain a large corpus of jokes in raw text format, that will 
later be used to train language model. For initial tests you can use 
the following existing datasets:
</p>
<p> 
Pun of the Day dataset: ~2500 puns; 16000 One Liners dataset: ~16000 
one line jokes; See 
[Yang, Diyi, et al. "Humor recognition and humor anchor extraction."](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.696.1901&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
</p>
<p> 
[Jester datasets](http://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/dataset/) : contains around 
150 jokes and ratings from large number of users for these jokes.
</p>
<p>
However, most likely to obtainin a reasonable language model more
data is required then what is available in listed datasets. 
Obtain such additional data by web scraping sites like 
https://www.reddit.com/r/jokes, 
http://funtweets.com/, 
http://funnytweeter.com/ 
and similar sites. 
Please make sure to obey the website policies with respect to the web scraping!
</p>
<p>
To further increase the amount of text that language model was trained on,
pretrain a language model on large corpus of regular text, for example
on [One Billion Words dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3005), which you can 
download [here](http://www.statmt.org/lm-benchmark/). This way the language
model will already be initialized with knowledge of general structures in 
English language; Fine tune such pretrained model on the jokes corpus. 
One of the outcomes of this research request is to determine whether pretraining
helps with joke generation.
</p>


<p>
Secondly, train large [language model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02410) 
on the jokes datasets, similarily as [in this post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).
Determine if the training setup is sufficient to generate funny jokes or
if the setup needs to be modified.
</p>

<p>Training such neural networks potentially allows to gain more insights
into the nature of humor, and hopefully give life to some good jokes.

</p>

<p>Potential follow up after this research request is solved is to create a 
setup in which created neural network is able to
post the jokes somewhere online where it can get reliable score feedback
for the jokes it generates and improve itself accordingly using RL.
