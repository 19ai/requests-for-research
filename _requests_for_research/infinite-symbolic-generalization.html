title: 'Infinite Symbolic Generalization'
summary: ''
difficulty: 3 # out of 3
---

<p>Many sequence prediction tasks involve uncertainty. Even the sequence <code>abababab...</code> may not repeat the same pattern forever. However, some sequences - algorithmic tasks - should generalize for an unbounded amount of time.</p>

<p>The goal is to develop models that can learn algorithms, such as the <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~reedscot/iclr_project.html">Neural Programmer-Interpreter</a>, and successfully apply the learned algorithms over sequences much longer than those used to train the model. One example would be to learn and apply a sorting algorithm over an array with hundreds of elements.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>If this project can be considered solved simply by using more training data, then a further challenge would be to minimise the amount of training data needed to perform "infinite generalization".</p>
